* Add a button to your webpage that swaps out an image when you click it (HINT: JavaScript)
* Sadly, the `<blink>` tag has been removed from html, re-implement it with JavaScript!
* Scrolling marques really help grab the attention of would-be-customers, so add one to your site
* Add a footer to your site with an "under construction" animated gif

### Caffeinated Mode

* Add a table of made up statistic calculations to your site (Like "# of Happy Vegetable Eaters by State")
